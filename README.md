Tiny chrome extension for speed reading

Crude chrome extension for testing a 9gag gif theory

Instructions:

1. Download the folder

2. Add the folder as an unpacked extension to Chrome
- Follow the first step from this guide https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted
- Open the Extension Management page by navigating to chrome://extensions.
(The Extension Management page can also be opened by clicking on the Chrome menu, hovering over More Tools then selecting Extensions.)
- Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.
- Click the LOAD UNPACKED button and select the extension directory.

3. You should see a black book icon among your extension icons

4. Reload a page, hit CTRL once to activate the reader and hover over a paragraph of text (hitting CTRL again will disable the extension ... it's a toggle)

5. Since this is a proof of concept, it only works on texts inside the paragraph tag.

6. Enjoy
